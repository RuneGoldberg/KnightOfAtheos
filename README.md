# Cedric: Holy Knight of Atheos, God of Unbelievers
Entry for NaNoWriMo 2018

In a world in which magic and the study of the arcane fall exclusively within the women's purview,
the Church seems the logical next-best option for the man in search of some supernatural aid. 

Follow our hero, Cedric, and his plucky band of codependents on a fantastical and ever more
implausible adventure, as he attempts to serve the gods despite not believing in them,
to smite down his enemies despite being a pacifist, and to follow his moral compass 
despite insisting that evil always seems to have the superior aesthetic. 

Will he discover that the power was inside him all along?
Will he realize that perhaps the real treasure was the friends we made along the way?
Will he finally manage to get over his evil ex girlfriend?

Honestly, I don't know either! Let's find out!
